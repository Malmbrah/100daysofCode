Importing modules

Basic import:
        #module
import turtle

#This is best practice if you use turtle a lot 
from turtle import Turtle  #Then you do not need to constantly write turtle.Turtle()

Import everything: 

#Can make it difficult to later see an indipendent module further down in the code
#Is usually not written
from turtle import *

Aliasing Modules:
import turtle as t 
tim = t.Turtle()

Instaling Modules
Sometimes you need to install modules if you want more functions. That is the pypi.org. - Python packages
